1. A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java.
   It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
2. Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
3. An interface is declared by using the interface keyword.
   It provides total abstraction; means all the methods in an interface are declared with the empty body,
   and all the fields are public, static and final by default.
   A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.   
   
   
We use the abstract keyword to create abstract classes and methods.
An abstract method doesn't have any implementation (method body).
A class containing abstract methods should also be abstract.
We cannot create objects of an abstract class.
To implement features of an abstract class, we inherit subclasses from it and create objects of the subclass.
A subclass must override all abstract methods of an abstract class. However, if the subclass is declared abstract, it's not mandatory to override abstract methods.
